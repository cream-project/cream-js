# Cream
Frontend goodies at your disposal. Modular, extendable and keeps things simple.

## cream-js
Collection of Javascript files. You can use them in any way you like, but they are made with the [Cream](https://github.com/cream-project) environment in mind.

The main file application.js uses [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) directives to include everything else.

The documentation format can be used with [Hologram](http://trulia.github.io/hologram/), to automatically generate a styleguide.

Check [STYLE.md](https://github.com/cream-project/cream-js/blob/master/STYLE.md) for coding conventions.
